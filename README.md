# asteroids
A simple version of the classic Asteroids written using functional paradigms 

This was also an assignment at university.

The unit I am doing is called programming paradigms. 
In this unit we are introduced to new ways of writing code, most notably we are introduced to the functional approach.

The functional approach to writing code implmements more complex polymorphic behaviour by using features like lambda expressions and higher order functions as opposed to the standard object oriented method which treats code as seperate obects with methods.

This code also has an interesting way of approaching async operations since the entire events system is wrapped in a class called "Observable" The observable class allows us to treat a series of events as a conslist (a type of functional list). 

It should be noted that I did not write observable, it was written by my lecturer for the unit Tim Dwyer.
