# asteroids
A simple version of the classic Asteroids written using functional paradigms 

This was also an assignment at university.

The unit I am doing is called programming paradigms. 
In this unit we are introduced to new ways of writing code, most notably we are introduced to the functional approach.
The functional approach to writing code implmements more complex polymorphic behaviour by using features like lambda expressions and higher order functions as apposed to the standard object oriented method which treats code as seperate obects with methods.
